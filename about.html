      <p><b>IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</b> The letter writing campaign Protect British Protest
        has been archived. We would like to sincerely thank everyone for their participation.
        While the Police, Crimes, Courts and Sentencing Bill is still being discussed in Parliament
        in the UK, it has now passed its readings in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, all hope
        is not lost for the legacy of peaceful protest in the UK. While the campaign has formally
        ended, if you feel strongly about this issue we encourage you to email your MP in contestation
        of this bill.</p>

          <h1>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN</h1>
          <h3>The Police, Crime, Courts & Sentencing Bill aims to curtail fundamental
           rights surrounding our right to peaceful protest.</h3>
           <p>The Bill gives police a broader authority to arrest protesters for
           behaviour that is difficult to quantify, like 'being too noisy', and to
           extend the maximum sentence for this manner of offence, from 3 months to
           a year. This
           letter-writing campaign aims to raise awareness about the undemocratic,
           draconian propositions of this bill, and to change the minds of MPs currently
           debating this bill in parliament.</p>

          <h3>A large number of people have expressed their opposition to this bill,
           including in the form of petitions, demonstrations, peaceful protests, and
         campaigns such as this. Protect British Protest aims to work in tandem with these.</h3>

        <h1>OPPOSITION TO THE POLICE, CRIME, COURTS & SENTENCING BILL</h1>

        <p><a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/579012" target = "_blank">A recent petition to the UK Parliament against the
          provisions in the Police, Courts & Sentencing Act</a> recently gained support from huge populations across the
          UK. It now has over 250,000 signatures and, as such, was debated in Parliament on April 26, 2021. Caroline Lucas,
          as MP for Brighton Pavilion, spoke in this debate and provided a great explanation of what's wrong with the Bill,
           and why we need to fight it.

      where concerned citizens may write directly to the prime minister. We encourage you to participate in this campaign too. </p>
