          <p><b>IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</b> The letter writing campaign Protect British Protest
            has been archived. We would like to sincerely thank everyone for their participation.
            While the Police, Crimes, Courts and Sentencing Bill is still being discussed in Parliament
            in the UK, it has now passed its readings in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, all hope
            is not lost for the legacy of peaceful protest in the UK. While the campaign has formally
            ended, if you feel strongly about this issue we encourage you to email your MP in contestation
            of this bill.</p>

        <h1>WELCOME TO THE CAMPAIGN</h1>
        <h3>The Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill, currently  being debated
        in UK Parliament, aims to limit our fundamental freedoms regarding protest.</h3>

        <p>If this bill comes to pass, everyone living in the UK can expect to
        see strict limits placed on their rights to protest and freedom of assembly
       and expression. This includes the grounds on which a police officer can arrest
      someone participating in a protest, and the type of sentence an arrested protester
     is likely to receive. Most importantly, many decisions about the type of conduct
    that is cause for the arrest of a protestor, may be made by the police themselves. </p>
