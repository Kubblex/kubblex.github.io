            has been archived. We would like to sincerely thank everyone for their participation.
            While the Police, Crimes, Courts and Sentencing Bill is still being discussed in Parliament
            in the UK, it has now passed its readings in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, all hope
            is not lost for the legacy of peaceful protest in the UK. While the campaign has formally
            ended, if you feel strongly about this issue we encourage you to email your MP in contestation
            of this bill.</p>

        <p>Dear <em>(insert MP name here)</em>, <br><br>


I am writing to you to express my deep concern about some of the provisions in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill presently being considered in Parliament.
<br><br>
I am particularly distressed by the proposed provisions in sections 54 – 56 and 59 – 60 of the Bill which seek to restrict and monitor all protests, regardless of their driving cause. The right to protest is a fundamental freedom and is essential for those who are disenfranchised in society to express their views on civil issues and have them heard by policy makers such as yourself. This view is supported by the European Convention of Human Rights, which contains the freedoms of expression and assembly and association in articles 10 and 11 respectively. According to the Convention, the only limitations which may be placed on these freedoms are those which are “necessary in a democratic society”. I strongly believe that the highly restrictive nature of the provisions in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill undermine and oppose the values of British democracy.
<br><br>
One area of the Bill I would particularly like to draw your attention to is the creation of new offenses for noise generated by public processions and protests in ss. 54(2) and 55(2) of the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill 2021. As it is currently proposed, if a senior police officer believes the noise from a protest may seriously disrupt nearby businesses or cause a relevant impact to people in the vicinity, the police officer may impose any condition on the organisers of the protest as they think “necessary to prevent the disorder, damage, disruption, impact or intimidation”. The assessment of whether to impose conditions on a protest will be made entirely on the judgement of the senior police officer, which is highly subjective. As it is currently proposed, there is no requirement for the noise generated by a protest actually cause disruption to a nearby business or to make a relevant impact on nearby people.
<br><br>
The implications of this subjective assessment are amplified by a proposed provision applicable to England and Wales which provides that anyone involved in the protest found to be breaching imposed conditions may be found guilty if, at they time of the breach, they had “ought to know” the condition(s). This means protesters will no longer need actual knowledge of the imposed condition(s) to convicted of a criminal offence (see ss. 56(3) and (4) of the Bill). The penalty for breaching a condition imposed on a protest by a senior police officer is proposed to be far harsher than the current provisions under the Public Order Act 1986. In relations to offences committed in England and Wales under ss. 12(4) and 14(4) of the 1986 Act (related to breaching conditions imposed on public processions and assemblies), the Bill seeks to increase the maximum possible imprisonment sentence from 3 months to 52 weeks (see ss. 56(6) and (11) of the Bill). This penalty is over four times more severe than what is currently in law, for an offence which will have a lower standard of proof.
<br><br>
I also would like to express grave concern over sections 59 and 60 of the Bill, which propose to strengthen police power to control anyone deemed to be causing public nuisance. While it is reasonable to implement offences for causing serious harm to the public resulting in death, personal injury, or disease, it is far harder to justify the creation of a blanket offence for individuals causing “serious annoyance, serious inconvenience, or serious loss of amenity” (see s. 59(2)(c) of the Bill). The proposed imprisonment lengths for intentionally or recklessly causing a public nuisance is proposed in s. 59(4) of the Bill to be up to 12 months on summary conviction and no longer than 10 years on indictment. These penalties, like the potential sentence increase for offences under ss. 12(4) and 14(4) of the Public Order Act 1986, seem severe and likely to function primarily in deterring people from any form of protest. Similarly, provisions in s. 60 of the Bill which propose police restrictions on the route of one-person protests and their entry into specified public places are disproportionate to the risks such protests pose in turning dangerous.
<br><br>
I understand that there is a concern amongst policy makers that some of the tactics seen at some protests lately constitute a risk to public safety and that the current solution to this is increasing police power to impose order. In writing this letter, I do not wish to defend the minority of individuals who turn otherwise peaceful protests violent, and I can understand why Parliament wishes to make protests safer.  However, the current provisions in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill go far beyond what is appropriate to limit the civil right to protest. By placing extensive limitations on organisers of protests and reserving the right to impose conditions on the subjective assessment of a senior police officer, this Bill seeks to silence anyone questioning or challenging the status quo. The harsh penalties proposed for the loosely defined offences in ss. 54 – 56 and 59 – 60 of the Bill will only serve to deter individuals from protesting for fear of being arrested and imprisoned. This is highly concerning, as the erasure of effective protests will leave only the most powerful able to influence and shape the laws and conventions of the United Kingdom. If women’s suffrage movements and equal rights campaigns have taught us anything, it is that the right to protest is an essential to the continuing betterment of society so that it is freer and fairer for all.
<br><br>
Although the majority of the provisions mentioned above will only be enforced in England and Wales if the Bill passes, I urge you to exercise your voting power in Parliament to remove or extensively amend provisions in the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill so that they better align with the democratic principles of the United Kingdom. If a precedent for restricting the right to protest is implemented in one part of the United Kingdom, I fear it will not be long before we see similar statute introduced in Scotland. Please use your voice to protect our right to protest from the excessive restrictions which risk being implemented into law.
<br><br>
Yours sincerely,
<br><br>
