          <p><b>IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</b> The letter writing campaign Protect British Protest
            has been archived. We would like to sincerely thank everyone for their participation.
            While the Police, Crimes, Courts and Sentencing Bill is still being discussed in Parliament
            in the UK, it has now passed its readings in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, all hope
            is not lost for the legacy of peaceful protest in the UK. While the campaign has formally
            ended, if you feel strongly about this issue we encourage you to email your MP in contestation
            of this bill.</p>

      <h1>FAQs</h1>
      <p><strong>What is this campaign about?</strong><br><br>

        Protect British Protest is a letter-writing campaign which encourages people living in the United Kingdom to contact their MP to vote against undemocratic provisions in the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill currently in progress in Parliament. The contested provisions seek to place excessive restrictions on both group and individual protests and introduce new, arbitrary offences which may result in lengthy imprisonment sentences. For a more detailed analysis of the issues this campaign is protesting, please look at the <a href="keyissues.html">key issues page</a>. <br><br>

        <strong>How can I get involved?</strong><br><br>

        Write a letter to your MP! You can either use the letter templates on
        this website (we have seperate templates for <a href="#">England & Wales</a> and for <a href="#">Scotland</a>), or
        you can write your own letter. Detailed instructions, including how to
        find out who your MP is, can be found on the <a href="instructions.html">instructions page</a>
         or if you want to learn more about the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Bill
         we are campaigning against, check out the <a href="keyissues.html">Key Issues page.</a><br><br>

        <strong>Who can participate in the campaign?</strong><br><br>

        Anyone currently living in the United Kingdom may participate. All you need is
        an address in the UK. <strong>This includes non-UK citizens:</strong> so long
        as you live  in the UK, you're allowed to participate.<br><br>

        <strong>What if my MP has already voted against the Bill?</strong><br><br>

        It is still worthwhile to send a letter of protest to your MP because it voices
        new and potentially unconsidered perspectives on why the provisions in this Bill
        are so dangerous. This campaign has a dual goal; to urge MPs to vote against the
        Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill in its parliamentary journey and to
        encourage them to voice our  concerns about the proposed restrictions on protests
        in parliamentary debate. We hope that by sending as many letters of protests to MPs
        as possible, a greater focus will be placed on protecting the right to protest
        from the provisions in the Bill. <br><br>

        <strong>Why does this campaign only targeting specific provisions in the Police,
        Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill? Why not stand against the Bill as a whole?</strong>
        <br><br>

        The Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill passed its second reading in Parliament
        on the 16th March 2021, with 359 votes for and 263 against. What this means is that the
        Bill as general concept has been approved by the majority of Parliament to pass into law.
        Unfortunately, this also means that it is a far harder task to ‘Kill the Bill’ completely
        at this stage in its parliamentary journey. What is still possible, however, is to advocate
        for the repeal or extensive amendment of the worst provisions in the Bill which will cause
        the most damage to the right to protest in the United Kingdom.  <br><br>

        <strong>What will I achieve by writing a letter to my MP?</strong><br><br>

        The aim of the letter of protest is to convince your MP to raise concerns about and
        vote against certain provisions in the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill
        which is currently in the approval process in Parliament. If enough MPs vocally
        oppose and vote against the contested provisions in the Bill, they will hopefully
        not get passed into British law. <br><br>

        <strong>Who do I send my letter to?</strong><br><br>

        Letters of protest are to be sent to the MP who represents your area in Parliament.
        Your MP and their email address can be found by typing in your postcode on the
        <a href="https://members.parliament.uk/members/Commons" target = "_blank">UK Parliament website</a>.
        Type  in your postcode or the name of your constituency, and your MP will
        come up. Click on their name and you will be taken to their webpage, which
        lists contact information including their email address. <br><br>

        <strong>Is it OK to share this campaign on social media?</strong><br><br>

        Please do! We want to raise as much awareness about this campaign as possble.
        That means sharing the campaign both in person and online. If you want to
        publicise this campain to a wider audience, please share on any social media
        with the hashtag #ProtectBritishProtest. Most MPs have twitter accounts, too,
        which you can find on their Parliament webpage. If you want to share the campaign
        on Twitter, write to your MP there and let them know you're participating!<br><br>

        <strong>I've received a response from my MP and I'm not sure whether to reply.
          What should I do?</strong><br><br>

        It is a function of your MP to address their constituents’ concerns so when
        individuals send a letter to an MP, they will often receive a reply. Most of the
        time this response will contain details of your MP's position on the subject and
        the steps they are taking in dealing with the matter. It is usually not neccessary
        to repond to this  but if you wish to reply to a communication from your MP regarding
        the campaign and don’t know how, please <a href="protectbritishprotest@gmail.com">contact me</a>
        and I will be more than happy to help. <br><br>

        <strong>Where can I find copies of the current law and proposed Bill?</strong><br><br>

        The current law regulating protests is avaliable to view online or to download
        <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/64/contents">from the UK government legislation website.</a>
         You can download and track the parliamentary progress of the Police, Crime, Sentencing
         and and Courts Bill <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2839">on the UK parliament website</a>.<br><br><br>

         If your question has not been answered here, you can send an email with
         your query to <a href="mailto:protectbritishprotest@gmail.com">protectbritishprotest@gmail.com.</a> There is no question too
