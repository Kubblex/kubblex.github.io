          <p><b>IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</b> The letter writing campaign Protect British Protest
            has been archived. We would like to sincerely thank everyone for their participation.
            While the Police, Crimes, Courts and Sentencing Bill is still being discussed in Parliament
            in the UK, it has now passed its readings in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, all hope
            is not lost for the legacy of peaceful protest in the UK. While the campaign has formally
            ended, if you feel strongly about this issue we encourage you to email your MP in contestation
            of this bill.</p>

      <h1>HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CAMPAIGN</h1>
      <h3>It's great that you want to get involved! Here are detailed
      step-by-step instructions describing what you can do to make your
    voice heard in this campaign. The whole process takes about five minutes.<br><br></h3>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Find your local MP.</strong>
      <a href="https://members.parliament.uk/members/Commons" target = "_blank">The UK Parliament website</a>
      has a useful resource which allows you to search for your MP by postcode. Once you've found
     your local MP, you can find their email address on their Parliament webpage.</li>
     <li><strong>Use one of the letter templates to write an email to your MP.</strong>
     Now that you know who your MP is, write them an email to express your concern at
   the provisions of the Police, Crime, Courts and Sentencing Act, currently being
 debated in parliament. If you like, you can <mark>use one of the <a href="lop.html">letter templates</a>
 found on this site</mark>, but you're welcome to write your own. If you want more information about
 what sort of information to include in your letter, please refer to the <a href="keyissues.html">Key Issues</a>
 section.</li>
    <li><strong>Let your MP know that you're writing as part of the Protect British Protest campaign.</strong>
     In the subject line of the email, write 'Urgent! Protect Our Right to Protest!'.
   If you're using one of the letter templates, you are encouraged to fill in the blanks with
 your name, your MP's name and your postcode in the appropriate places. If you don't want to
include your name on the letter, then feel free to omit it.</li>
    <li><strong>Send the email to your MP.</strong> That's it! Thanks again for participating in
    the letter writing campaign.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you need help with any of the above steps or require assistance with anything else related
      to the campaign, please do not hesitate to contact me for assistance at
      protectbritishprotest@gmail.com. Thank you for your participation in the Protect British Protest campaign!</p>
