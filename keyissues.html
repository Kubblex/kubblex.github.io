          <p><b>IMPORTANT INFORMATION:</b> The letter writing campaign Protect British Protest
            has been archived. We would like to sincerely thank everyone for their participation.
            While the Police, Crimes, Courts and Sentencing Bill is still being discussed in Parliament
            in the UK, it has now passed its readings in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, all hope
            is not lost for the legacy of peaceful protest in the UK. While the campaign has formally
            ended, if you feel strongly about this issue we encourage you to email your MP in contestation
            of this bill.</p>

      <h1>WHAT DOES THE POLICE, CRIME & SENTENCING BILL CONTAIN?</h1>
      <h3>Listed here is a detailed analysis on the key issues this campagin is protesting in the Police,
         Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill. I would also recommend looking through the <a href="lop.html">Letters of Protest</a> as they may contain
         information not included in this factsheet. <br><br></h3>

      <p><strong>Sections 54, 55, and 56 – imposing restrictions on public processions and protests.</strong>

        <br><br>

The current law governing restrictions on public processions and protests can be found in the Public Order Act 1986. The 1986 Act outlines that when a protest or other public procession is happening, a senior police officer nearby may give a written direction or condition to the organisers of the protest. Such conditions may dictate the protest’s route or ban its entry into specified public places in accordance with what the senior police officer sees the condition as necessary to preventing disorder, damage, disruption, or intimidation caused by the protest. A senior police officer may only impose a direction or condition on a protest if he reasonably believes the protest may cause serious public disorder, serious damage to property, or serious disruption to the life of the community, or if he reasonably believes that the purposes of the organisers of the protest are to intimidate others to either do an act they are not permitted to do or to not do an act they have a right to do. Under ss. 12(4) and 12(5) POA 1986, it is an offence if an organiser or a participant of the protest knowingly breaches a condition, however it is provided in the current law that it is a defence to say this breach was due to circumstances outside of the defendant’s control. <mark>Because of these built-in defences in the Public Order Act 1986, people can organise and attend protests without fear of having arbitrary conditions imposed on the protest</mark> and being arrested for breaching conditions they have no knowledge of. <br> <br>

If the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill passes into law, <mark>these built-in protections for protestors will no longer exist.</mark> According to the Bill, senior police officers could theoretically impose any condition on the organisers and attendees of a protest as they see necessary to prevent the disorder, damage, disruption, or intimidation caused by the protest. The circumstances in which a senior police officer may impose a condition have also been expanded in ss. 54(2) and 55(2) to include situations where the noise from a protest may cause a relevant impact on persons in its victinty (relevant impacts being defined as serious unease, alarm, or distress) or a serious disruption to an organisation in the vicinity of a protest (which has not yet been legally defined). <mark>There will be no limits on the types of conditions senior police officers can legally impose on protestors</mark>, and as such conditions could range from anything to the use of microphones in a protest to the number of people who are allowed to participate. If applied moderately, such conditions are a logical method of ensuring public safety at protests, but <mark>under the new law, imposed conditions may potentially be so severe and limiting that they thwart effective protest.</mark>
    <br><br>

The Bill also aims to downgrade the requirement to prove that an organiser or participant of a protest must know about the condition they are breaching. If the Bill gets passed, under new law itt will be sufficient to show that the condition was one that the protester ought to have known about for their breach of it to be an offence. This is a subjective assessment which could easily be taken advantage of to prosecute anyone involved in a protest. Moreover, <mark>the sentence for the offence of breaching an imposed condition of a protest is proposed to become incredibly harsh.</mark> Under the Public Order Act 1986, the penalty for knowingly breaching a condition imposed on a protest is a fine and/or a maximum 3-month imprisonment sentence. Section 56 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill proposes to increase this potential sentence to 52 weeks, which is over 4 times as long as what is currently in law, for an offence which is set to have a lower standard of proof. Combined, all of the proposed changes on the regulation of protests and linked offences found in the Bill will function to act as a deterrent from organising and participating in protests due to the high risk of criminal liability for doing so.

    <br><br><br>
    <strong>
    Sections 59 and 60 – imposing restrictions on one-person protests and creating an offence of public nuisance.
    </strong> <br><br>
    The second area of the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill this letter-writing campaign concerns seeks to <mark>introduce new offences which will impede most forms of individual protest</mark>. Section 59 of the Bill details the creation of a criminal offence for causing a ‘public nuisance’, which is any act or ommission to act that causes serious harm to the public or obstructs the public in the enjoyment of a right that may be exercised or enjoyed by the public at large. Serious harm is defined in section 59(2) as acts which, amongst other things, cause a person “to suffer serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience, or serious loss of amenity”. The maximum penalty for an offence of this nature is proposed to be 1 year’s imprisonment on a summary conviction and up to 10 years on indictment. The offence of public nuisance will likely work in tandem with the provisions in section 60 of the Bill, which detail circumstances in which a senior police officer may impose conditions on a one-person protest. Under the current law in the Public Order Act 1986 there are no offences related to individual protests, but the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill lists an offence with a penalty of up to 51 weeks in prison. This offence works similarly to the offences discussed above in that any person carrying on an individual protest who breaches a condition imposed by a senior police officer on the protest will be criminally liable. <mark>The protester does not even need to know the condition that has been imposed on the offence;</mark> it is sufficient to prosecute so long as the court determines the protester ought to have known about the condition. These restrictions, particularly on one person protests, are extremely severe and highlight the function of Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill as reducing effective protest rather than making protests safer for the public.
    <br><br><br>
    <strong>
    What does this mean for Scotland?
    </strong><br><br>
    The majority of the provisions this campaign in the Police, Crime, Sentencing, and Courts Bill will only apply to England and Wales, with Scotland mostly retaining old law under the Public Order Act 1986. However, Scottish MPs will still vote on this Bill in Parliament, therefore it is important to write to them too in order to make sure we achieve as much resistance to the Bill in the parliamentary debate process as possible.
